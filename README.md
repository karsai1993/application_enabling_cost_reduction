# Application enabling cost reduction
This was my final project at University Master Degree.

## What the code is for?
The code is for showing how to observe the power consumption of a Windows-based computer. It also requires user interaction to choose from the available tasks which the program should perform.
Additionally, it shows how to create a responsive User Interface by the help of Java Swing.

## How to build/install?
- download the code
- import into eclipse/netbeans or any other IDE
- run and enjoy :)
